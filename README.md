## Pest Disease Detection 

Pest Disease Detection is a generated AI-based mobile application designed to assist users in identifying and managing plant diseases and pests. The app utilizes an AI-powered image recognition model to analyze pictures of damaged plants and provide users with instant, accurate diagnoses.

The backend is built with Laravel, which serves as the API for the mobile app and powers a dedicated admin panel. The admin panel allows for the management of diseases, their descriptions, and corresponding prevention methods.

## Key Features:
 AI-Powered Detection: Users can upload a photo of a damaged plant, and the AI model will identify the specific disease or pest.

Detailed Information: The app provides comprehensive details about the detected disease, including its causes, symptoms, and effective precaution and treatment methods.

Admin Panel: A robust Laravel-based admin dashboard to manage disease data, model updates, and user information.

This project aims to provide an accessible and efficient tool for farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts to protect their crops and plants from common ailments.
